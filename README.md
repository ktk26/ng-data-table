# Table Requirements

Table Example: table-example.png

1. It will be a dropdown and it shows one more value named as Branch. Table datas has to be changed based on the dropdown selection.
2. The total row value is calculated dynamically from the below rows and the total values should be formatted($x.xxM, $x.xxK) as per references provided.
3. Sorting functionality has to be enabled. When doing the sorting(ascending/descending) functionality total row values(first row) position should not change.
4. Particular row should be deleted when clicking the X button and the total value needs to be changed accordingly.
